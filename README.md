# Scrapping-data-from-websites
In this project, we will explore the fascinating world of web scraping using Python.
We'll delve into the process of extracting data from websites programmatically, allowing us to gather valuable information from the vast array of online resources available. 
Through hands-on examples and step-by-step guidance, we'll learn how to send HTTP requests, download web pages, parse HTML content, and extract specific data elements. 
By the end of this project, you'll have a solid understanding of web scraping techniques and how to leverage them effectively to extract data for analysis, research, or automation purposes.
